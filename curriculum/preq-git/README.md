# Git Pre-req: The Foundation

**Date:** 2026-02-08 (Before Week 1)

## Why Git Matters for You

In Pega, you have version history built into the platform. In real coding, YOU own your version control.

**Git is like:**
- Pega's version history → but for every file
- Your safety net → never lose work again
- Your portfolio → show your progress

## Your Mission

### Step 1: Install Git
```bash
# Check if installed
git --version

# If not installed, download from git-scm.com
```

### Step 2: Set Up Git
```bash
git config --global user.name "Prashanth"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### Step 3: Your First Repository
```bash
# Create a folder
mkdir my-first-code
cd my-first-code

# Initialize Git
git init

# Create a file
echo "Hello, real code!" > hello.txt

# Add and commit
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "My first commit - from Pega to Python!"
```

## Why This Matters

As a Pega developer, you know how important it is to track changes.
Git is that for your code — and MORE.

💡 Yash's Tip: "I use Git every single day. It's not just for backups — it's for thinking."
