# 🚀 Prashanth's Journey: From Pega to Python/React AI Full Stack Developer

> "Coding is not harder than Pega — it's just different. And more powerful."

---

## 📖 The Story

Meet **Prashanth**. He's a Pega developer who's been building no-code solutions for years. He knows rules, flows, data pages, and integrations like the back of his hand.

But lately, he's felt something:

> *"I can build anything in Pega... but I'm stuck inside a platform. I want to build REAL code."*

That's where this journey begins.

## 🎯 The Mission

**12 weeks. 5+ deployable projects. One goal: From Pega to Python/React AI Full Stack Developer.**

---

## 🗺️ The Path

```
Week 1-3   │ Python Basics          │ Pega Rules → Python Functions
Week 4-6   │ React Frontend         │ Pega Sections → React Components
Week 7-8   │ Backend & Databases    │ Pega Activities → Express Routes
Week 9-10  │ AI Integration         │ Adding Intelligence
Week 11-12 │ Full Stack Projects    │ Portfolio + Job Ready
```

---

## 🔗 The Bridge

You already think like a developer. You just need to learn the syntax.

| Pega Concept | Code Equivalent |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Rule | `def function():` |
| Data Page | `useState()` / Context |
| Activity | `app.get('/api/...')` |
| Section | `<Component />` |
| Flow | `async/await` |
| Case Type | Database Model |
